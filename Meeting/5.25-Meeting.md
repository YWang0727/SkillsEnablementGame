# 5.25-Meeting
## Meeting with David:

### 1. Priority
Prioritise tasks when multitasking, doing the ones we consider important first (e.g. the project itself).
### 2. IBM single login system
Ideally with direct access to the IBM login platform for game login.
### 3. Game engine
The initial decision was made to use Godot as the game development engine.
### 4. Database connections
Using springboot, database data is requested via http. At this stage can focus on the front end first and do development that does not store data. Access the database at a later stage.
### 5. HTTP VS WEBSOCKET
HTTP has some latency and is not suitable for scenarios such as instant messaging, but it is enough for our gaming projects. WEBSOCKET has no latency, but has problems with mobile devices.
### 6. Tiles
It can be done as a rectangle (which renders up faster) or as a hexagon. A pseudo-3D effect can be created by constructing isometric meshes.
### 7. Infinity Map
It is possible to make an unlimited number of maps, but only draw the part of the screen that appears on it at a time, ignoring the rest of the map.
### 8. IBM cloud
Need to run servers and databases on the cloud. When required, an unlimited free cloud account can be requested from John.
### 9. Simple game demo
Tobe uploaded to github.

## TODO
### 1. Start learning Godot, e.g. simple game events, loops
