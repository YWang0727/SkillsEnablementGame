# 6.12-Meeting
## Team Internal Meeting:
### 1. Front-end and back-end development order
It was decided to develop the Godot-based front-end part first for now. Most of the front-end UI design, basic functional code and interaction between the components will be completed first, while leaving the APIs to the back-end in place. The front-end functionality is tested with simulated data. Then the back-end will be written.


### 2. Task allocation
We have basically divided the front-end development into these modules: the learning scene, the click & place module for the main scene, other functional components, and the login system.

The initial allocation of work is as follows:
- Click & Place module: Xufeng yin
- Login system: Xinyue Zhang
- Functional components: Hanyu Li, Siru Zhang
- Learning scene: Yue Wang


### 3. Artistic style
Initially make own parts, make initial forms, then consider unifying the art style etc.
