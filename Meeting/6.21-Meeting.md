# 6.21-Meeting
## Meeting with David:

### 1. Continue sending John regular updates
The record to summarize what we've done each time.

### 2. Integrate work regularly
Develop each part independently, but integrate work regularly. In case something does not quit fit together, and some one in team would like to use the some part of project code.

### 3. Design process in project report
Something likes background for the project or the process of project completion . Rather than  a part of project body, it is a extra information about  process to achieve it.

It can be included:

-  The design process ( eg : We designed the 7 types of houses, but we found it is too complicated or we don't need so, so we cut down the types to 5, because it is more interesting. And the design decision is referred to the communication with database......)

- How idea and code evolved over time

- Any discussions when we have different ideas and conflict

-  Things we learned from this project

-  screen shot

- any thing explains the project background
