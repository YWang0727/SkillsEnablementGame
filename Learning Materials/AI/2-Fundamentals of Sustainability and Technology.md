## Fundamentals of Sustainability and Technology

### Make an Impact with Hybrid Cloud

#### Course overview

##### Can hybrid cloud help save the planet?

In order to stop global warming and the impacts of climate change, the annual 51 billion tons of carbon emitted into the atmosphere would need to be cut down to zero, then, the following industries would need to take urgent and immediate actions to reverse the global temperature rising 1.5 degrees Celsius. These are the industries that need to take this urgent action and the percent they contribute to the current problem: 

- Industrial (steel, cement, plastic) – 31 percent
- Energy and Electricity (coal, oil, gas) – 27 percent
- Farming (crops, plants, and animals) – 19 percent
- Transportation (airplanes, cars, trucks, and ships) – 16 percent
- Heating and Cooling (air conditioning, refrigeration) – 7 percent

Although carbon emissions from information technology (IT) only make up 1 to 2 percent of global emissions, this number is expected to increase by 1000 percent over the next 10 years. One approach to this challenge is green computing, also defined by the IBM Institute for Business Value as environmentally sustainable computing. 

**Hybrid cloud** addresses this pressing issue by combining two different online data storage types: **private cloud**, which provides maximum security by storing only one organization’s data (such as hospital or bank records), and **public cloud**, which stores information for several organizations who don’t need as much security. When organizations move their data onto hybrid cloud, this form of green computing can reduce their IT’s carbon emissions by up to 90 percent!

#### Module1: What is hybrid cloud?

##### Introduction

In this module, you’ll learn the definition of hybrid cloud, and you’ll complete an activity applying what you’ve learned about hybrid cloud and sustainability.

##### **Learning objectives** 

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Define cloud computing
- Describe key differences between private, public, and hybrid cloud computing

##### Take a closer look at hybrid cloud

In simple terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over internet servers instead of using servers owned and operated by individual organizations. **Hybrid cloud** is a mixture of **private cloud** (highly secure cloud computing for a single organization) and **public** cloud (somewhat less secure cloud computing shared by more than one organization). 

Hybrid cloud computing enables organizations to manage the largest data libraries in human history. And it’s green! Consider Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Uber, and Airbnb. People use these services to listen to music, watch movies, buy items, get rides, or make reservations. They all store vast amounts of data in hybrid cloud.

#### Module2: How does hybrid cloud support sustainability?



##### Introduction

In this module, you’ll learn how hybrid cloud is a part of an overall strategy of sustainability.

###### Learning objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Identify ways that hybrid cloud can promote green computing

- Trace the steps of a green IT implementation

  

##### What makes hybrid cloud sustainable?

Now that you have a better understanding of hybrid cloud, check out this video on how hybrid cloud supports sustainability.

In the video, you heard IBM’s Manish Chawla explain his point of view on the future of the industry and what a hybrid cloud approach provides. He mentions that industrial companies need to move toward **net-zero**, a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero to help our environment. Hybrid cloud will play a part in that goal.

###### **Data centers**

Companies have often relied on company-owned and operated physical data centers. But migration to cloud computing could reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 60 million tons a year. That’s the equivalent of taking 22 million cars off the road!



Sustainable computing (let’s call it **green IT**) starts with physical data centers. The global power capacity of data centers has grown by 43 percent in the last 3 years. More computing power makes these centers big guzzlers of electric power which, in many areas, is generated by power plants with significant emissions of carbon and health-threatening pollutants.



Data centers can reduce their energy demands with sustainable coding. Software developers can play a pivotal role in promoting responsible computing and green IT. Developers can program using green coding and design—using the right coding language for the right workload to reduce computing power and, therefore, energy usage. Something as simple as switching from one programming language to another can reduce an application’s energy consumption up to 50 percent.



Data centers can also promote sustainability by moving to hybrid cloud. Instead of a narrow focus on the energy efficiency and emissions of individual servers or data centers, hybrid cloud allows leadership to focus on improving the sustainability of their entire IT operations. As leaders expand their focus on reducing the carbon footprint of their organizations, they can use hybrid cloud for their data, workloads, and applications, helping reduce the amount of energy consumed across the enterprise. 

There are many more steps a data center must take to develop sustainable operations. Many of these steps include hybrid cloud. Think about why a bank would want its data center to become more sustainable.



#### Module 3: Case Study -Ybrid Cloud Makes Peoplesafe During Severe Weather

##### Introduction

In this module, you’ll learn how IBM Cloud helped **The Weather Company** meet extreme scalability challenges to deliver accurate weather information around the world.

###### Learning objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to describe sustainability applications of hybrid cloud.



##### Let’s review a real-life case study!

Check out this video to learn how rapid changes in weather can mean big danger.

###### **Can hybrid cloud prevent deadly hurricane outcomes?**

At about 8:00 PM on Saturday, September 8, 1900, in Galveston, Texas, a category 4 hurricane surprised the community, leading to about 10,000 deaths and complete destruction of the city. The US Weather Bureau at the time believed the storm was going to be much smaller and weaker. It was the deadliest natural disaster in American history. 

Compare these statistics to what happened when a category 4 hurricane struck Louisiana. On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana at about 5:00 AM. The weather.com and wunderground.com sites tracked the hurricane and provided continuous life-saving information. Thanks in part to hybrid cloud technology, only 20 people died in Louisiana because of the storm, compared to about 10,000 deaths in Galveston a century earlier.

###### **The Weather Company**

The Weather Company (TWC) has been in production on IBM Cloud since 2018. TWC has seamlessly handled high-volume events generated by dozens of hurricanes, floods, and tropical and winter storms. The Weather Company’s websites serve millions of users per day around the world. When extreme weather hits and usage peaks, the sites must be at their fastest and most reliable to provide the information people need to stay safe. To meet these challenges, The Weather Company has built its entire web platform around hybrid cloud.

###### Instant insight when it matters most

Many companies build their web platforms on the assumption that predictable factors will drive the traffic they need to serve. For example, a retailer expects extended seasonal peaks around the winter holidays, with sharp spikes for major events such as Black Friday. Scaling to handle increased demand can be challenging, but long-term planning makes holiday peaks a solvable problem.

Weather websites like weather.com and wunderground.com, however, face an exponentially harder scalability challenge. And their ability to perform at a high level during periods of intense demand can determine the difference between life and death.

During major weather events, The Weather Company relies on its hybrid cloud infrastructure to deliver very high performance when its servers are under the most intense load. Extreme weather systems are often fast-moving and difficult to predict, so to handle massive, short-notice peak workloads, the company depends on the ability to scale up rapidly at any time using hybrid cloud.

Wendy Frazier, Head of Consumer Web Development and Content Delivery at The Weather Company, explains: 

“During Hurricane Sandy, our sites served close to 9 petabytes of video data in one day. It’s really important that the system can scale because our volumes can go from one extreme to the other, overnight.”

Check out this video to learn more about The Weather Company’s transition.

###### **Extreme weather is extremely local**

Since weather is a local phenomenon, the scalability of the web platform needs to be localized, too. As The Weather Company expands its operations into markets such as Japan, India, and Eastern Europe, it needs to be able to harness local data centers to bring its endpoints closer to the user. Localizing TWC’s data centers adds further complexity to the challenge because each location must be able to scale its computing needs up or down swiftly: a tornado in the US Midwest creates demand peaks in that region, with little effect on operations elsewhere.

The weather.com site is now fully in production on the IBM Cloud, and The Weather Company team is impressed with the performance and scalability of the platform.

> The world’s top weather property now runs on IBM Cloud, giving us the hyper-scale elasticity we need to handle even the most dramatic spikes in traffic. The most important thing is that we can continue to scale our platforms to help people stay safe when extreme weather hits.

In this case study, you learned how transitioning to hybrid cloud helped The Weather Company improve its ability to provide accurate, reliable, and quick forecasts around the world. TWC has been in full production on IBM Cloud since 2018. In the meantime, TWC has seamlessly handled high-volume events generated by dozens of hurricanes, floods, and tropical and winter storms.
