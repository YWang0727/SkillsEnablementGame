### About project:
Learning can be a solitary experience  - and also In the short term a potentially challenging experience too. To help and encourage people to avail themselves of learning experiences that will enrich their lives - we need to make learning more fun, engaging and collaborative.  


Create a city building game In the form of a web app - where the user builds elements of their city by completing learning experiences.  Each specific learning experience will offer a boost or 'buff' to the city. So for example - completing Agile and Design Thinking learning experiences will allow the city to progress at a faster rate (In terms of building facilities for the population). Whereas AI and Automation could reduce cost of goods and Items - making the population happier.  


In the game there will be other cities being built - either by AI or other players. If one city progresses beyond the other cities - then the population will slowly move from other cities Into the more advanced one. This In turn will provide the resources for the city to grow and build new capabilities.


The winner of the game Is the city which has the most population (or all of the population) on the map.  


Learning experiences are to be taken from:  
Skills Build: https://skillsbuild.org/  
IBM Academic Initiative: https://www.ibm.com/academic/home  


To test whether a user has successfully completed a learning experience the game will ask questions to test the knowledge of the user. Once the questions are answered the new capability will be unlocked.  


For Inspiration on the look of the game - review games such as Tribal Wars.
