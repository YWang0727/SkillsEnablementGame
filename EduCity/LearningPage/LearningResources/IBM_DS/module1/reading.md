[font_size={40}][b][center]Let's explore the topics included in this Module![/center][/b][/font_size]


[font_size={40}][b][center]Topic 1: The urgency of science[/center][/b][/font_size]

In this topic, we'll explore how data scientists use the scientific method to frame their thinking and solve complex problems. 
Throughout this topic, we will attempt to answer the following questions:


[font_size={30}][b]How does the scientific method apply to the field of data science?[/b][/font_size]

A pandemic is taking lives and livelihoods. Climate change threatens to drown cities and disrupt food supplies. Economic growth widens inequalities. These are some of the urgent problems society is wrestling with, where science, guided by our values, is critical to our progress.
[b]Humanity is facing great uncertainty.[/b]
Rather than guessing at solutions—especially with so much at stake—we, as a society, need to implement scientific thinking at all scales—from our daily lives to corporate innovation to government policymaking.
[b]We as a society need to implement scientific thinking at all scales.[/b]
While great progress has been made, there are great risks to our future. We must find new methods and solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges. The need to take a scientific approach to these problems is more urgent than ever.
[b]Scientific thinking isn’t just for scientists[/b]
Scientists may seem to occupy a rarefied world apart, with their PhDs and high-tech equipment, and stylish lab coats. But scientific thinking is within everyone's reach.
Textbooks may change as we update our ideas about geology, medicine, and physics, but the method used to update them hasn't changed all that much.
New discoveries nearly all rely on some version of the scientific method. Applying this method and the technological transformation we’re bringing to it will be key to the next breakthroughs.


[font_size={30}][b]What is the Scientific Method?[/b][/font_size]

[ul]The Scientific Method is the practice of science as a way of thinking about knowledge.[/ul] 
[ul]It means asking how we know things. [/ul] 
[ul]It means coming up with new ideas and making careful observations that can refute or support them so that we know even more. [/ul] 
[ul]It means poking at the world to see what happens. [/ul] 
[ul]It means describing your methods of inquiry in such a way that others can repeat them independently, and communicating outcomes in a way that other scientists can interpret and understand them; [/ul] 
[ul]and it means updating our knowledge when the unexpected happens.[/ul] 

[b]Using an example[/b]
[ul]You might read about fertilizers and wonder what kind would help your vegetables grow the fastest.[/ul] 
[ul]The more expensive of the two fertilizer brands will make your vegetables grow taller.[/ul] 
[ul]Use each fertilizer on half of your garden, then collect and analyze the data to see which plants grew taller.[/ul] 

[b]Trust in Science[/b]
Thinking scientifically also means being aware of what others have already tried and discovered. Any given scientific paper might reference hundreds of others, which shows how science constantly builds on what came before.
This reliance on and trust in scientific knowledge comes from science’s commitment to transparency in a way that allows any scientist to challenge any idea at any time. Decisions should be informed by data and evidence.

[b]Science Can’t Be Contained[/b]
When you imagine the domain of a scientist, you might think of the natural sciences—physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, astronomy, and so on. 

But the scientific method can help us to think about how discovery in the natural sciences can influence or be influenced by critical social decisions—involving psychology, politics, and business.

To answer some of these questions:
[ul]Can we design molecules to pull carbon dioxide out of smog? [/ul]
[ul]Do we have already-approved drugs that might help COVID-19 patients? [/ul]
[ul]Where should we look to spot the next pandemic-causing bug?[/ul]

We need to better understand the world we live in:
[ul]The effect of natural sciences on the broader issues[/ul]
[ul]How policy and economic trends affect the natural sciences？[/ul]
[ul]How do societal decisions affect societal outcomes?[/ul]

[b]And now, the data scientist who works with data begins to ask questions that start with why.[/b]

Why did life move from the primordial oceans to land? Did the moon and the tides have something to do with it?

Why is life based on carbon? After all, it is right next to silicon on the periodic table and has the same electron valance.

Our sun is a G-type star. 4 billion years down and 4.5 billion years to go. It will turn into a white giant and then a red dwarf. So how long do we have on Earth?

One of the key attributes of the scientist that works with data (Data Scientist) is an eternal curiosity factor. Always asking why. Data is a commodity, but without ways to process it, its value is questionable. Data science is a multidisciplinary field whose goal is to extract value from data in all its forms. Throughout this course, we will explore the field of science through data and its structure, as well as the high-level process that you can use to transform data into value. 

Data science is a process. That's not to say it's mechanical and void of creativity. But, when you dig into the stages of processing data, from munging data sources and data cleansing to machine learning and eventually visualization, you see that unique steps are involved in transforming raw data into insight.


[font_size={30}][b]So, what is the relationship between Science and Data Science?[/b][/font_size]

You may wonder, what does science has to do with data? Well, the starting point of science is collecting data. We collect data on animals, plans; we collect data on minerals, elements, and even stars. Once we have ample data, we classify them:

[ul]Data collected from animals and plans go into phylogenetic trees[/ul]
[ul]Those gathered from minerals go into crystal groups[/ul]
[ul]Data collected from elements finds its way into the periodic table[/ul]
[ul]Data collected from  stars are plotted in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram[/ul]

[b]What is Data Science?[/b]
It is the understanding the world through the scientific analysis of the digital representation of data.

[font_size={30}][b]Summary[/b][/font_size]

1)New discoveries rely upon the scientific method: asking a question, generating a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis, and publishing the results. 

2)One the most essential attributes of a data scientist is having an intense curiosity about things. 

3)Data science is a process. When you dig into the stages of processing data, from munging data sources and data cleansing to machine learning and eventually visualization, you see that unique steps are evolved in transforming raw data into insight. 



[font_size={40}][b][center]Topic 2: What is Data Science?[/center][/b][/font_size]

[font_size={30}][b]What is data science?[/b][/font_size]
Data science is a multidisciplinary approach to extracting actionable insights from the large and ever-increasing volumes of data collected and created by today’s organizations. Data science encompasses preparing data for analysis and processing, performing advanced data analysis, and presenting the results to reveal patterns and enable stakeholders to draw informed conclusions.

Data preparation can involve cleansing, aggregating, and manipulating it to be ready for specific types of processing. Analysis requires the development and use of algorithms, analytics and AI models. It’s driven by software that combs through data to find patterns within to transform these patterns into predictions that support business decision-making. The accuracy of these predictions must be validated through scientifically designed tests and experiments. And the results should be shared through the skillful use of data visualization tools that make it possible for anyone to see the patterns and understand trends.As a result, data scientists (the umbrella term for any data science practitioner) require computer science and pure science skills beyond those of a typical data analyst. 

A data scientist must be able to do the following:
[ul]Apply mathematics, statistics, and the scientific method[/ul]
[ul]Use a wide range of tools and techniques for evaluating and preparing data—everything from SQL to data mining to data integration methods[/ul]
[ul]Extract insights from data using predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning models [/ul]
[ul]Write applications that automate data processing and calculations[/ul]
[ul]Tell—and illustrate—stories that clearly convey the meaning of results to decision-makers and stakeholders at every level of technical knowledge and understanding[/ul]
[ul]Explain how these results can be used to solve business problems[/ul]

This combination of skills is rare, and it’s no surprise that data scientists are currently in high demand. 

[font_size={30}][b]What factors led to the rise of data science as an independent field?[/b][/font_size]

[b]Evolution of data science[/b]

[center][img=1500]user://LearningPage/LearningResources/IBM_DS/module1/images/topic2_01.jpg[/img][/center]
- The evolution of DS is best studied with a three-pronged approach: statistical sciencescompute power, and digital data.
- Notice the statistical approaches have evolved from a mere calculation to prediction andnow to prescriptive approaches
- All the while, the compute power of the machine has increased exponentially over thepast decades
- In conjunction with that, the sheer volume of data has also grown exponentially andgotten cheaper per volume storage space

[center][img=1500]user://LearningPage/LearningResources/IBM_DS/module1/images/topic2_02.png[/img][/center]
- In the later part of the 19th century and the first three decades of the 20th century,statistical analysis of big data started to take shape
- US census that used to take over 10 years was performed in less than 2.5 years。Tabulating machines lead to universal machines, as envisioned by Alan Turing
- Stored data mushroomed from a mere 80 bytes that fit on to punch cards to over 62,000bytes
- The main advancement here was that the machine was able to perform repetitivecomputing operations in record time and with very high accuracy

3)Data science arose in the late 19th century as a means of doing statistical analysis. From there, it evolved with the introduction of computers and the capacity to collect and process ever-growing amounts of data. 



[font_size={40}][b][center]Topic 3: The 'Data' in Data Science [/center][/b][/font_size]

In this topic, we'll define what data science is as well as its emergence as a field of study.

[font_size={30}][b]What factors have led to the explosive growth of data in the 21st Century?[/b][/font_size]

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a giant network of connected things and people – all of which collect and share data about the way they are used and about the environment around them. 

That includes an extraordinary number of objects of all shapes and sizes – from smart microwaves, which automatically cook your food for the right length of time, to self-driving cars, whose complex sensors detect objects in their path, to wearable fitness devices that measure your heart rate and the number of steps you’ve taken that day, then use that information to suggest exercise plans tailored to you. There are even connected footballs that can track how far and fast they are thrown and record those statistics via an app for future training purposes. 

We are all digitally connected in real - time, anywhere in the world.

[b]How does it work?[/b]
Devices and objects with built-in sensors are connected to an Internet of Things platform, which integrates data from the different devices and applies analytics to share the most valuable information with applications built to address specific needs. These powerful IoT platforms can pinpoint exactly what information is useful and what can safely be ignored. This information can be used to detect patterns, make recommendations, and detect possible problems before they occur.

[b]For example[/b]
If I own a car manufacturing business, I might want to know which optional components (leather seats or alloy wheels, for example) are the most popular. Using Internet of Things technology, I can:
[ul]Use sensors to detect which areas in a showroom are the most popular and where customers linger longest[/ul]
[ul]Drill down into the available sales data to identify which components are selling fastest[/ul]
[ul]Automatically align sales data with supply so that popular items don’t go out of stock. The information picked up by connected devices enables me to make smart decisions about which components to stock up on based on real-time information, which helps me save time and money.[/ul]

With the insight provided by advanced analytics comes the power to make processes more efficient. Smart objects and systems mean you can automate certain tasks, particularly when these are repetitive, mundane, time-consuming, or even dangerous. 

Let’s look at some examples to see what this looks like in real life.

[b]Collecting huge amounts of data about how the world works[/b]

From traffic patterns and music downloads to web history and medical records, data is recorded, stored, and analyzed to enable the technology and services that the world relies on every day.

[b]Consider these statistics:[/b]
- 2.5 Quintillion bytes of data created every day. (That’s 2,500,000,000,000,000, 000 bytes)90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone.
- Every minute 1.7 MB of data is created for every person on the planet. All 7.3 billion of us.
- We were trying to build a system that can deal with this massive amount of data because human intelligence is not scaling in the way that data is scaling.

[b]Creating a digital representation of the physical world[/b]
Industry and science now can come together to explore new solutions to existing challenges

[b]Bringing it all together[/b]
In the video below your instructor will guide you through these concepts:
[url=]https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/129791800[/url]

[font_size={30}][b]How have cognitive systems fueled the need for more efficient methods of data collection and analysis?[/b][/font_size]

Cognitive Computing are systems that learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally.

It is a mixture of computer science and cognitive science – that is, the understanding of the human brain and how it works. By means of self-teaching algorithms that use data mining, visual recognition, and natural language processing, the computer is able to solve problems and thereby optimize human processes.

[b]Bringing it all together[/b]
Watch the video "The Future of Cognitive Computing" to learn about the interaction between data and cognitive computing:
[url=]https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/130015879[/url]

Cognitive systems have the potential to reshape computing and are an area of computing that you should not ignore. It’s very easy when we get into areas of Cognitive Computing and Artificial intelligence to rapidly drop down to Deep Machine Learning and algorithms. These are exciting and fascinating areas of technology, but I think the thing we must keep in mind is “Towards what end?”

[b]What is it that we are trying to do?[/b]
[ul]Changing the world[/ul]
[ul]Changing entire industries[/ul]
[ul]Seeing things and getting insights that we have never been able to grasp before.[/ul]
I encourage you to think about what we can do with this technology as well as how can we impact society in ways that we’ve never been able to before?

[b]What are we after here?[/b]
It’s also very tempting to talk about what we’re trying to do as replicating what human brain does, but that is not at all what this is about. We were not trying to do what previous AI researchers were trying to do. We were not trying to mimic the human brain. We were trying to do something very simple -- to analyze and garner insight from this massive amount of data.

[b]These devices will need to be cognitive.[/b]
They will need to make real-time decisions about the environment based on learning about the environment and learning about driver behavior. Every single industry is being swamped with data. Every industry is trying to access that 80-90% of dark data and get insights to differentiate. We are at an industry inflection point.

[font_size={30}][b]What's the difference between structured and unstructured data?[/b][/font_size]

All data is not created equal. Some data is structured, but most of it is unstructured.

Structured and unstructured data is sourced, collected and scaled in different ways, and each one resides in a different type of database. 

[b]Data in the world today:[/b]
[ul]Every industry problem and societal challenge can now be addressed by understanding its underlying data[/ul]

[font_size={30}][b]Summary[/b][/font_size]

1)Massive amounts of data is being produced globally, in large part because of IoT devices, social media, and cloud technology.  

2)Cognitive (AI) systems can assist data scientists in their task of collecting and making sense of all of this generated data, greatly reducing time, money, and effort.

3)Data can be filtered into 5 broad characteristics, 'the 5 Vs', to help data scientists make sense of what they are working with.
[b]Volume[/b] - Having a sense of the amount of data which needs to be processed.
[b]Variety[/b] - What types of data are you working with, and are they unstructured or structured data.
[b]Velocity[/b] - How quickly is the data being generated.
[b]Veracity[/b] - How accurate is the data.
[b]Value[/b] - Not all data holds equal weight for a given tasks, data analysts need to able to filter out the noisy data to find what they are looking for. 

4)Data falls into two broad categories: structured and unstructured.Structured Data is is highly organized and easily decipherable by machine learning algorithms. Unstructured Data cannot be processed and analyzed via conventional data tools and methods.



[font_size={40}][b][center]Topic 4: Data science domains[/center][/b][/font_size]

[font_size={30}][b]What skills are needed to be an effective data scientist?[/b][/font_size]

A data scientist must possess three skills : hacking skills, math/statistics knowledge, and substantive expertise. 

Each of these skills on their own is very valuable, but when combined with only one other is at best simply not data science, or at worst downright dangerous. 

[b]Science, Technology, and Data are intrinsically connected.[/b]

[b]Three topics have Data Science and AI available for many companies right now[/b]
[ul][b]The evolution of data:[/b] A factor contributing to the massive adoption of AI is the exponential growth of available data. With the introduction of the Internet, social media, the proliferation of sensors and smart devices, combined with the fact that data storage became cheaper, it became more accessible than ever before.[/ul]
[ul][b]The mechanization of scientific advances into applicable algorithms:[/b] Algorithms have been around since we could write. Recently, the development of more advanced algorithms has helped AI and Machine Learning become more powerful and efficient..[/ul]
[ul][b]The evolution of technology:[/b] Another major factor in AI’s current success is its computing power. Back when AI was just beginning to be developed, the computing power was minimal. Computers nowadays can take much more data and heavier algorithms than in the 1950s.[/ul]

[b]Bringing it all together[/b]
In the video below your instructor will guide you through these concepts:
[url=]https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/129791806[/url]

[b]Categories behind data science[/b]

Data Science:
[ul]Machine learning[/ul]
[ul]Statistical modeling[/ul]
[ul]Experiment design[/ul]
[ul]Statistics, research, mathematics [/ul]

Data Analysis:
[ul]Domain expertise[/ul]
[ul]Strategic problem solving[/ul]
[ul]Business acumen[/ul]
[ul]Communication skills[/ul]
[ul]Visualization skills[/ul]
[ul]Decision making based on insights[/ul]

Data Engineering:
[ul]Database and data storage[/ul]
[ul]Scripting language[/ul]
[ul]Artificial Intelligence[/ul]
[ul]Cloud Infrastructure[/ul]
[ul]Statistical computing[/ul]

[b]A data scientist must possess all three skills. Let me explain why.[/b]

For better or worse, data is a commodity traded electronically; therefore, in order to be in this market, you need to speak hacker. This, however, does not require a background in computer science—in fact—many of the most impressive hackers I have met never took a single CS course. Being able to manipulate text files at the command-line, understanding vectorized operations, thinking algorithmically; are the hacking skills that make for a successful data hacker. Once you have acquired and cleaned the data, the next step is to extract insight from it. In order to do this, you need to apply appropriate mathematical and statistical methods, which require at least a baseline familiarity with these tools. This is not to say that a Ph.D in statistics is required to be a competent data scientist, but it does require knowing what an ordinary least squares regression is and how to interpret it.

Data plus math and statistics only gets you machine learning, which is great if that is what you are interested in, but not if you are doing data science. Science is about discovery and building knowledge, which requires some motivating questions about the world and hypotheses that can be brought to data and tested with statistical methods. On the flip-side, substantive expertise plus math and statistics knowledge is where most traditional research falls. Doctoral level researchers spend most of their time acquiring expertise in these areas but very little time learning about technology. Part of this is the culture of academia, which does not reward researchers for understanding technology. That said, I have met many young academics and graduate students that are eager to buck that tradition.

Finally, a word on the hacking skills plus substantive expertise "danger zone". This is where I place people who, "know enough to be dangerous," and is the most problematic area of the diagram. In this area, people who are perfectly capable of extracting and structuring data, likely related to a field they know quite a bit about and probably even know enough R to run a linear regression and report the coefficients; but they lack any understanding of what those coefficients mean. It is from this part of the diagram that the phrase "lies, damned lies, and statistics" emanates, because either through ignorance, or malice this overlap of skills gives people the ability to create what appears to be a legitimate analysis without any understanding of how they got there or what they have created. Fortunately, it requires near - willful ignorance to acquire hacking skills and substantive expertise without also learning some math and statistics along the way. As such, the danger zone is sparsely populated, however, it does not take many to produce a lot of damage.

[b]Bringing it all together[/b]
In the video below your instructor will guide you through these concepts:
[url=]https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/129791809[/url]

[font_size={30}][b]Summary[/b][/font_size]

Three factors are leading to the growth and popularity of using AI systems in Data Science: 
1)The sheer volume of data being produced
2)Mechanization of systems and the advent of sophisticated AI algorithms
3)Advancements in technology allow for more data to be collected, stored, and processed.



[font_size={40}][b][center]Topic 5: Data science roles[/center][/b][/font_size]

In this topic, we'll explore the unique roles of the data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer. 

[font_size={30}][b]How is a Data Science team structured?[/b][/font_size]

In practice, several people work on a team to build data products. Your analyses will only be as good as the team that is responsible for collecting, building, and analyzing the underlying data. 

Data Science isn’t just about frameworks, data sources, and pipelines—it’s also about people. Enterprises embarking on a Data Science journey have a much greater opportunity for success when they have executive leadership support and the right talent in key Data Science roles.

[b]Data science is a team sport.[/b]

The greatest challenge of the big data revolution is making sense of all the information generated by today’s vast digital economy. It’s well enough for an organization to collect every slice of data it can reach, but how does it extract value from this massive volume of information?

The more data you have, the better the quality of your reports and strategic recommendations, right? Sure...if you can analyze that data intelligently and quickly and make it actionable with valuable insights. Otherwise, more data can mean more problems: messy data, storage woes, security risks, frustrated business teams, and overloaded IT staff. So how do you figure out what you really want from your data—and which data can get you those answers? How do you turn raw metrics and records into information that has (and drives) actual business value? Do you have the skills your business needs to drive results? Successful organizations build data science teams that incorporate different skill sets and responsibilities instead of relying on a few elite individuals.

In practice, several people work on a team to build data products. Your analyses will only be as good as the team that is responsible for collecting, building, and analyzing the underlying data.

[b]What does the data science team bring to the table?[/b]

The deeper programming types, such as data engineers and front-end developers, bring consumability to data science. The mathematics and data scientist types use statistical algorithms to find patterns in data. Throughout the process, everything needs to align with the preferred business outcome, which is guided by the eye of the business analyst. Working together, the data science team can outthink today’s challenges and problems to create new opportunities and possibilities for tomorrow. Which talents and abilities define the members of a data science team, and how do they complement each other?

[b]Bringing it all together[/b]
In the video below your instructor will guide you through these concepts:
[url=]https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/130917630[/url]

[font_size={30}][b]What are the primary role and responsibilities of the data analyst? [/b][/font_size]

Data Analytics involves finding the right data in these data systems, cleaning it for the purposes of the required analysis, and mining data to create reports and visualizations. 

Good Data Analysts select and address the business problems that have the most value to the organization. Armed with data and analytical results, they must present their informed conclusions and recommendations to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

[b]Who is a Data Analyst？[/b]

To be a Data Analyst, you need to be in constant communication with the business users. 

[b]Line of business users[/b]
This encompasses all users that consume the output of data science analytics, for example, business analysts analyzing dashboards to monitor the health of a business or the end-user using an application that provides a recommendation as to what to buy next.

[b]Characteristics[/b]
[ul]Great communicator and presentation skills[/ul]
[ul]Critical thinking and agile design[/ul]
[ul]Familiar with visualization tools[/ul]

[b]Role[/b]
[ul]Domain exploration and understanding[/ul]
[ul]Collect and analyze data[/ul]
[ul]Understand data[/ul]
[ul]Explain and visualize results[/ul]
[ul]Communicate with stakeholders[/ul]

[b]Bringing it all together[/b]

[url=]https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/130917646[/url]

[font_size={30}][b]What are the primary role and responsibilities of the data scientist? [/b][/font_size]

Data Scientists take Data Analytics even further by performing deeper analysis on the data and developing predictive models to solve more complex data problems.

Solving problems and answering questions through data analysis is quickly becoming the norm in today’s data-driven world. As real-world experiments become ubiquitous in modern business, the data scientist is evolving into the role that stokes, tweaks, and fuels this operational engine.

[b]Who is a Data Scientist?[/b]

Data scientists are often referred to as “unicorns” because they have a rare combination of talents: they handle a variety of responsibilities and skill sets covering mathematics, statistics, domain expertise, communications, and more. 

[b]Characteristics[/b]
[ul]Is eternally curious - What? Why? How?[/ul]
[ul]Research mindset[/ul]
[ul]Versed in statistics and math[/ul]
[ul]Constantly being in the “know”[/ul]

[b]Role[/b]
[ul]Collect and analyze data[/ul]
[ul]Extract insights from patterns using machine learning models[/ul]
[ul]Explain and visualize results[/ul]

Basically, the job of the data scientist is to look for hidden patterns. They accomplish this by applying advanced analytics techniques, including (but not limited to) machine learning, modeling, statistics, and visualization. Often, data scientists will construct models to predict outcomes or discover underlying patterns; their game plan is to produce actionable insights that can be used to improve future outcomes.A good data scientist will not just address business problems; he or she will zero in on the problems that have the most value to the organization.

Because data scientists are involved in each step of the journey in building data products, they tend to bring a holistic view to solving problems with data. However, they can’t be experts in everything—this is where their team can help. They experiment continuously by deploying new predictive models, business rules, and orchestration logic into next-best-action-powered applications.

A skilled data scientist explores and examines data from multiple disparate sources. They will pore through all incoming data with the goal of linking new information to historical data to find a relationship or trend that offers a crucial competitive advantage or addresses a pressing business problem. They don’t just collect and report on data; they look at it from many angles, determine what it means, and then recommend ways to apply the findings. They need to make sure their queries are correct and must be able to back up their conclusions with sound models and trusted data—as the data scientist is often expected to present recommendations to management and executive teams.

Data scientists are distinguished by their strong business acumen, plus the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. The data scientist often becomes the liaison between the IT department and C-level executives. Therefore, he or she must be able to speak both “languages” and understand the hierarchy of data—they can’t just be a data expert. This also means data scientists must have a solid understanding of the business as well as the conviction to stand behind their findings in the face of opposition.

Data scientists are inquisitive and curious: exploring, asking questions, doing what-if analyses, and questioning existing assumptions and processes. A data scientist’s technical skills often include multiple programming languages, familiarity with big data management and analysis tools like Apache Hadoop and Spark, and experience with tools that help them visualize data and insights.

[font_size={30}][b]What are the primary role and responsibilities of the data engineer? [/b][/font_size]

Data Engineering entails managing data throughout its lifecycle and includes the tasks of designing, building, and maintaining data infrastructures. 

These data infrastructures can include databases – relational and NoSQL, Big Data repositories and processing engines – such as Hadoop and Spark, as well as data pipelines – for transforming and moving data between these data platforms.

[b]Who is a Data Engineer?[/b]

The data scientist may be responsible for uncovering hidden patterns in data, but where do you think they get their data, and what happens when their solutions need to scale to thousands of users or handle sensitive information? Data scientists can only go so far without proper support to operationalize their work.

Enter the data engineer. At a high level, data engineers help gather, organize and clean the data that data scientists will ultimately use to build their analysis. If data scientists extract value from data, data engineers make sure data flows smoothly from source to destination so it can be processed.

[ul]Tech savvy[/ul]
[ul]Programming skills (Python, Golang, Java, etc.)[/ul]
[ul]Can perform math and statistics operations[/ul]
[ul]Frequently uses Machine Learning API calls[/ul]
[ul]Familiar with infrastructure architecture[/ul]

[b]Role[/b]
[ul]Transforms raw data into usable pipelines[/ul]
[ul]Utilizes advanced programming techniques[/ul]
[ul]Test and deploy Machine Learning models[/ul]
[ul]Manages the data infrastructure[/ul]

Data engineers are responsible for setting up systems and processes that other data workers—including data scientists—use and rely on to work with data. Data engineers must understand how to finesse the flow of data to minimize movement latencies and bring agility to analytics. They also work with front-end developers when moving data science projects into production.

In many organizations, a data engineer will oversee integrating data, including designing, building, and measuring data ingestion and integration pipelines for large volumes of temporal data from different sources. Examples include database extracts, application server logs, scanned images, voice recordings, Twitter streams, websites, and health sensor data. Once continuous pipelines are installed—to and from these huge “pools” of filtered information—data scientists can pull relevant data sets for their analyses.

Data engineers are often tasked with laying the groundwork for a data analyst or data scientist to easily retrieve the data needed for their evaluations and experiments.

[b]Top skills for data engineers[/b]

Data engineers are hard-core engineers who understand the internal workings of database software. They compile and install database systems, write complex queries, scale them to multiple machines, manage backups and deploy disaster recovery systems. They develop, construct, test, and maintain architectures such as databases and large-scale data processing systems.

Good data engineers are always learning and thinking about which new technologies will help them drive the business forward. This prompts them to develop a deep programming background, as well as cultivate familiarity with Hadoop-based technologies such as MapReduce, Hive, and Pig. Data engineers usually have significant experience with SQL-based technologies and NoSQL technologies, as well as data warehousing methodologies and solutions such as extract, transform, load (ETL).

[font_size={30}][b]How do other supporting roles add value to the data science team? [/b][/font_size]

Data Science isn’t just about frameworks, data sources, and pipelines—it’s also about people. Enterprises embarking on a Data Science journey have a much greater opportunity for success when they have executive leadership support and the right talent in key Data Science roles.

Here are suggestions from IBM concerning who should be on a Data Science team. Our experience suggests that these specific roles should be filled to get buy-in on the project and create a successful solution.

[b]Team behind Data Science[/b]

[b]Product Owner[/b]
The Product Owner providing business guidance, user research support, and serving as a consultant in terms of understanding the business need of the company in relation to the Data Science project in scope. 

[b]Developer[/b]
Although developers don’t always have a fully dedicated position within a data science team, they are an essential piece of the puzzle. A successful project usually productizes the data science work so it can serve an internal stakeholder or external customer. Baking data science into business processes is how companies build competitive advantage through data.
Developers often come in at the end of the data science workflow. They are responsible for building the applications where the models will sit—applications that leverage the insights and data gathered from the rest of the data science team. This requires a fair amount of programming time, and it can be a challenging job. Lack of integrated technologies can stifle developers’ progress, making it difficult to embed the data science team’s analysis.

[b]The Business Analyst[/b]
The Business Analyst — sometimes is referred to as the citizen analyst — provides business-level expertise and guidance to the data science teams. Their responsibility is to apply domain knowledge and make data-informed decisions.
The business analyst understands what the business needs but doesn’t have the technical background to develop a detailed analysis. Improvements in technology and a deeper understanding of the user profile have turned them into “analytical consumers,” allowing them to make decisions based on data insights. Flexible and user-friendly technologies allow them to develop some business-level analysis without coding and without having to ask the data scientist. This gives business analysts more independence, increasing the chance they will use the data science team’s findings in their everyday analyses.
